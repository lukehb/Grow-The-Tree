# Grow-The-Tree

Long ago (2014?), back in the days of Unity 3.5, back before 2d physics was bundled with the engine me and my friend made a game. 
This is that game.

Tentatively title "Grow The Tree", it is an arcade high-score game where you grow an unwieldy metal tree - and don't let things hit the ground.

Well, you've made it this far, why not play it: http://growyourtree.herokuapp.com/
(Note: you'll need to find a browser that still supports Unity Web Player).
It has a top-10 high scorers, let me know if you make it on there - but you won't :)
